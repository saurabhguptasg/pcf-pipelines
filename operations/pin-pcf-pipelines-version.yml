# Pin the git release of pcf-pipelines to a specific version. This is required
# because the resource normally pulls the latest from master, which will #
# eventually cause your pipeline to break.  If the version you pin isn't
# available in Concourse, meaning it hasn't seen that version for some reason,
# you can tell it about that version via `fly check-resource`:
# https://concourse.ci/fly-check-resource.html
#
# e.g. fly -t your-target check-resource -r your-pipeline-name/pcf-pipelines --from ref:v0.15.0

- op: add
  path: /get=pcf-pipelines/version
  value:
    ref: v0.15.0
